mrjc-v9pm,New York City's Flood Vulnerability Index,Mayor's Office of Climate and Environmental Justice (MOCEJ),"The Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) assesses the distribution of vulnerability to flooding across NYC in order to guide flood resilience policies and programs. Vulnerability contains three components: exposure to a hazard, susceptibility to harm from the exposure, and capacity to recover (Cutter et al., 2009). There are six hazard-specific FVIs, one for each of the six different flood hazard scenarios, which include current and two future storm surge scenarios and current and two future tidal flooding scenarios. Exposures vary for different types of flooding and different scenarios within each flood type. 

Each FVI consists of two component sub-indices: an exposure index and an index that reflects susceptibility to harm and capacity to recover. The exposure index is different in each FVI in order to capture the different exposures to each of the flood hazard scenarios. The sub-index that reflects susceptibility to harm and capacity to recover -- the Flood Susceptibility to Harm and Recovery Index (FSHRI) -- is the same for each FVI. It aggregates 12 socio-economic indicators correlated with various types of hardships that people may suffer due to flooding and different dimensions of ability to recover.

'Dewatered solids' are the solids remaining in digested sludge after removal of water in a dewatering facility. 'Biosolids', per the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), is treated sewage sludge that meets the EPA pollutant, pathogen & vector attraction requirements for land application and surface disposal, and the DEP has certified it with the EPA as such. 

Biosolids in this case are also dewatered. Depending on the material being managed (i.e., dewatered solids or biosolids), a 'management practice site' may be one of the following: 1) a third party vendor treatment facility (e.g., composting, dryer, alkaline treatment) that converts the dewatered solids into biosolids for beneficial reuse in various land application practices (e.g., agricultural land application, reclamation site application) or for distribution/marketing as a soil amendment or fertilizer; 2) a direct  land application site for agricultural use (typically a farm); or 3) a landfill. The dataset includes the pathogen (disease-causing organism) reduction and vector (an animal capable of transmitting disease such as flies or rodents) attraction reduction options employed as part of the treatment and the type of biosolids class produced, if applicable. There are different biosolids class types, each having specified treatment requirements for pollutants, pathogens and vector attraction reduction, as well as general requirements and management practices,

vtsq-3d95,Early Relationship Abuse Prevention Program (Early RAPP) Pre and Post Surveys,Mayor's Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV),"The Early Relationship Abuse Prevention Program (Early RAPP) seeks to help middle schoolers identify unhealthy behaviors to prevent them from forming patterns of abuse while learning to build healthy relationship skills at a critical time in their development. Importantly, Early RAPP works to create a school culture that supports those respectful relationships, and creates safe spaces for young people to seek help for themselves and their peers. Community Educators facilitate interactive workshops for students, parents, and community members, as well as trainings to school staff.
The Early RAPP aims to improve student knowledge and understanding of the types of abuse and healthy relationships. In order to measure the changes in knowledge and attitudes resulting from their workshops and trainings, Community Educators conduct surveys before and after workshops. Every school year, Community Educators are required to conduct at least three workshops in the fall semester and at least three workshops in the spring semester, in which pre- and post-workshop surveys are conducted. Participant responses are anonymous. The Early RAPP pre- and post-workshop surveys are identical, consisting of fourteen standard questions about teen dating violence and healthy relationships with response options: Agree/Disagree (10 questions) and Healthy/Not Sure/Unhealthy (4 questions). The questions aim to measure each participant’s understanding of the topics covered in the workshop.

To account for the delay in the start of the school year, enrollment counts are based on the November 13 Audited Register for 2020-21 and the November 12 Audited Register for 2021-22. 
   * Please note that October 31 (and November 12-13) enrollment is not audited for charter schools or Pre-K Early Education Centers (NYCEECs). Charter schools are required to submit enrollment as of BEDS Day, the first Wednesday in October, to the New York State Department of Education.""
Enrollment counts in the Demographic Snapshot will likely exceed operational enrollment counts due to the fact that long-term absence (LTA) students are excluded for funding purposes.
Data on students with disabilities, English Language Learners, students' povery status, and students' Economic Need Value are as of the June 30 for each school year except in 2021-22. Data on SWDs, ELLs, Poverty, and ENI in the 2021-22 school year are as of March 7, 2022.
3-K and Pre-K enrollment totals include students in both full-day and half-day programs. Four-year-old students enrolled in Family Childcare Centers are categorized as 3K students for the purposes of this report. 
All schools listed are as of the 2021-22 school year. Schools closed before 2021-22 are not included in the school level tab but are included in the data for citywide, borough, and district. Programs and Pre-K NYC Early Education Centers (NYCEECs) are not included on the school-level tab.
Due to missing demographic information in rare cases at the time of the enrollment snapshot, demographic categories do not always add up to citywide totals.
Students with disabilities are defined as any child receiving an Individualized Education Program (IEP) as of the end of the school year (or March 7 for 2021-22).
NYC DOE ""Poverty"" counts are based on the number of students with families who have qualified for free or reduced price lunch, or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) benefits. In previous years, the poverty indicator also included students enrolled in a Universal Meal School (USM), where all students automatically qualified, with the exception of middle schools, D75 schools and Pre-K centers. In 2017-18, all students in NYC schools became eligible for free lunch. In order to better reflect free and reduced price lunch status, the poverty indicator does not include student USM status, and retroactively applies this rule to previous years. 
""The school’s Economic Need Index is the average of its students’ Economic Need Values. The Economic Need Index (ENI) estimates the percentage of students facing economic hardship. The 2014-15 school year is the first year we provide ENI estimates. The metric is calculated as follows:
   * The student’s Economic Need Value is 1.0 if:
         o The student is eligible for public assistance from the NYC Human Resources Administration (HRA);
         o The student lived in temporary housing in the past four years; or
         o The student is in high school, has a home language other than English, and entered the NYC DOE for the first time within the last four years.
   * Otherwise, the student’s Economic Need Value is based on the percentage of families (with school-age children) in the student’s census tract whose income is below the poverty level, as estimated by the American Community Survey 5-Year estimate (2020 ACS estimates were used in calculations for 2021-22 ENI). The student’s Economic Need Value equals this percentage divided by 100.

Due to differences in the timing of when student demographic, address and census data were pulled, ENI values may vary, slightly, from the ENI values reported in the School Quality Reports.

In previous years, student census tract data was based on students’ addresses at the time of ENI calculation. Beginning in 2018-19, census tract data is based on students’ addresses as of the Audited Register date of the given school year. 

In previous years, the most recent new entry date was used for students with multiple entry dates into the NYCDOE. Beginning in 2018-19, students’ earliest entry date is used in ENI calculations.

Beginning in 2018-19, students missing ENI data are imputed with the average ENI at their school.
""
In order to maintain student privacy,  schools with % Poverty and ENI values below 5% or above 95% have had their exact values for each category replaced with ""Below 5%"" and ""Above 95%"", respectively.
Before the start of the 2017-18 school year, the New York State Education Department implemented a new data matching process that refined the methods to identify families eligible for free lunch. This new matching system provides a more efficient and accurate process for matching students across a range of forms that families already complete. This new matching process yielded an increase in the number of students directly certified for free lunch (in other words, matched to another government program) and therefore increased the direct certification rate. As such, the increase in the percent of students in poverty and the Economic Need Index for the 2017-18 school year and later reflects this new matching process, which allows the City to better identify students eligible for free lunch.
Approximately 25% of charter schools in NYC do not use NYC DOE School Food to provide meal services. The NYC DOE Office of School Food does not collect documentation on students’ eligibility for Free or Reduced Price Lunch from schools that do not utilize NYC DOE School Food. As a result, the Poverty figures may be understated for approximately 25% of charter schools. 
New York State Education Department begins administering assessments to be identified as an English Language Learner (ELL) in Kindergarten, but students in Pre-K are still included in the denominator for the ELL calculations. Also, Pre-K NYC Early Education Centers  do not use NYC DOE School Food to provide meal services, but are included in the denominator for Poverty calculations.",9251,15140,5350,Education,,2022-06-15T13:11:21+0000,2022-06-16T21:10:26+0000,2022-06-15T13:15:05+0000,2022-06-16T21:10:26+0000,data.cityofnewyork.us,,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/c7ru-d68s,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/c7ru-d68s

DCWP's Office of Financial Empowerment (OFE) also developed NFH Indexes to present patterns in the data within and across neighborhoods. NFH Index scores describe relative differences between neighborhoods across the same indicators; they do not evaluate neighborhoods against fixed standards. OFE intends for the NFH Indexes to provide an easy reference tool for comparing neighborhoods, and to establish patterns in the relationship of NFH indicators to economic and demographic factors, such as race and income. Understanding these connections is potentially useful for uncovering systems that perpetuate the racial wealth gap, an issue with direct implications for OFE’s mission to expand asset building opportunities for New Yorkers with low and moderate incomes.

2. Room Detail Information - Includes the room number and square footage of each room type assigned to each school by building, and whether that room is shared. Rooms shared by some or all schools in the building are only listed once but should be tagged as “shared.”
3. Bathroom and Non-instructional Space by Building Information - Includes the number of student bathrooms in each building, whether they are open all the time, whether any bathrooms are shared, the number of non-instructional spaces used for instruction or other student services, and whether any of those non-instructional spaces are shared.
4. Meal Periods - Data reported is for the 2020-2021 school year. 45 minutes is used as the standard period length.

gqq2-hgxd,2016-17 - 2020-21 School End-of-Year Attendance and Chronic Absenteeism Data,New York City Department of Education,"Overall attendance data include students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Schools & Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers or District Pre-K Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K. Transfer schools are included in citywide, borough, and district counts but removed from school-level files.
Attendance is attributed to the school the student attended at the time. If a student attends multiple schools in a school year, the student will contribute data towards multiple schools.
Starting in 2020-21, the NYC DOE transitioned to NYSED's definition of chronic absenteeism. Students are considered chronically absent if they have an attendance of 90 percent or less (i.e. students who are absent 10 percent or more of the total days). In order to be included in chronic absenteeism calculations, students must be enrolled for at least 10 days (regardless of whether present or absent) and must have been present for at least 1 day. The NYSED chronic absenteeism definition is applied to all prior years in the report.
School-level chronic absenteeism data reflect chronic absenteeism at a particular school. In order to eliminate double-counting students in chronic absenteeism counts, calculations at the district, borough, and citywide levels include all attendance data that contribute to the given geographic category. For example, if a student was chronically absent at one school but not at another, the student would only be counted once in the citywide calculation. For this reason, chronic absenteeism counts will not align across files.
All demographic data are based on a student's most recent record in a given year.
Students With Disabilities (SWD) data do not include Pre-K students since Pre-K students are screened for IEPs only at the parents' request.
English language learner (ELL) data do not include Pre-K students since the New York State Education Department only begins administering assessments to be identified as an ELL in Kindergarten.
Only grades PK-12 are shown, but calculations for ""All Grades"" also include students missing a grade level, so PK-12 may not add up to ""All Grades"". 
Data include students missing a gender, but are not shown due to small cell counts.
Data for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders . Multi-racial and Native American students, as well as students missing ethnicity/race data are included in the ""Other"" ethnicity category.
In order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with five or fewer students are suppressed, and have been replaced with an ""s"". Using total days of attendance as a proxy , rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an ""s"" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute  at least 20 days is five or fewer. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.
Interactions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:
• Student submission of an assignment or completion of an assessment, in whichever manner the school is collecting
• Student participation in an online forum, chat log, or discussion thread
• Student/family phone call, email or response to teacher email
• Phone, email, and/or other digital communication with a family member which confirms student interaction/engagement
• Other evidence of participation as determined by the principal.
Interactions data are attributed to students' school of record on a given day. A student participating in a Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have recorded interactions at multiple schools on a given day, but only one record is counted for the interaction rate, attributed to students' school of record for that day.
Due to the shift to hybrid learning, attendance data for the 2020-21 school year include both in-person and remote instruction. Total days, days absent, and days present fields include both in-person and remote attendance.

Using total days of attendance as a proxy , rows with 900 or fewer total days are suppressed. In addition, other rows have been replaced with an ""s"" when they could reveal, through addition or subtraction, the underlying numbers that have been redacted. Chronic absenteeism values are suppressed, regardless of total days, if the number of students who contribute  at least 20 days is five or fewer. 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shift to remote learning in March 2020, 2019-20 attendance data was only available for September 2019 through March 13, 2020. Interactions data from the spring of 2020 are reported on a separate tab.
Interactions were reported by schools during remote learning, from April 6 2020 through June 26 2020 (a total of 57 instructional days, excluding special professional development days of June 4 and June 9). Schools were required to indicate any student from their roster that did not have an interaction on a given day. Schools were able to define interactions in a way that made sense for their students and families. Definitions of an interaction included:
• Student submission of an assignment or completion of an assessment, in whichever manner the school is collecting
• Student participation in an online forum, chat log, or discussion thread
• Student/family phone call, email or response to teacher email
• Phone, email, and/or other digital communication with a family member which confirms student interaction/engagement
• Other evidence of participation as determined by the principal.
Interactions data are attributed to students' school of record on a given day. A student participating in a Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have recorded interactions at multiple schools on a given day, but only one record is counted for the interaction rate, attributed to students' school of record for that day.
Due to the shift to hybrid learning, attendance data for the 2020-21 school year include both in-person and remote instruction. Total days, days absent, and days present fields include both in-person and remote attendance.

NYC Parks, in collaboration with the Department of Education (DOE) and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land have improved hundreds of DOE operated schoolyards through capital improvements, including play equipment, painted sports surfaces, trees, and benches.
 
The program is an important approach to reaching the city’s target to getting more New Yorkers within walking distance to open-space. In many neighborhoods, these DOE schoolyards are one of the few resources that can be improved and provide publicly accessible open space.
 
Each record in this dataset represents a participating DOE Schoolyard at the time of the dataset's publication. The schoolyard's boundaries have been drawn in whole or part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original sources. Site-specific conditions should be field-verified.

This dataset may be updated throughout the year as school's join or exit the program.

Categories with total enrollment values of zero were omitted.
Pre-K data includes students in 3-K.
Data on students with disabilities, English language learners, and student poverty status are as of March 19, 2021. 
Due to missing demographic information in rare cases and suppression rules, demographic categories do not always add up to total enrollment and/or citywide totals.
NYC DOE ""Eligible for free or reduced-price lunch” counts are based on the number of students with families who have qualified for free or reduced-price lunch or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) benefits.
English Language Arts and Math state assessment results for students in grade 9 are not available for inclusion in this report, as the spring 2020 exams did not take place.
Spring 2021 ELA and Math test results are not included in this report for K-8 students in 2020-21. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic’s complete transformation of New York City’s school system during the 2020-21 school year, and in accordance with New York State guidance, the 2021 ELA and Math assessments were optional for students to take. As a result, 21.6% of students in grades 3-8 took the English assessment in 2021 and 20.5% of students in grades 3-8 took the Math assessment. These participation rates are not representative of New York City students and schools and are not comparable to prior years, so results are not included in this report. 
Dual Language enrollment includes English Language Learners and non-English Language Learners. 
Dual Language data are based on data from STARS; as a result, school participation and student enrollment in Dual Language programs may differ from the data in this report. STARS course scheduling and grade management software applications provide a dynamic internal data system for school use; while standard course codes exist, data are not always consistent from school to school.
This report does not include enrollment at District 75 & 79 programs. Students enrolled at Young Adult Borough Centers are represented in the 9-12 District data but not the 9-12 School data.
“Prior Year” data included in Comparison tabs refers to data from 2019-20. “Year-to-Year Change” data included in Comparison tabs indicates whether the demographics of a school or special program have grown more or less similar to its district or attendance zone (or school, for special programs) since 2019-20. Year-to-year changes must have been at least 1 percentage point to qualify as “More Similar” or “Less Similar”; changes less than 1 percentage point are categorized as “No Change”. 
The admissions method tab contains information on the admissions methods used for elementary, middle, and high school programs during the Fall 2020 admissions process. Fall 2020 selection criteria are included for all programs with academic screens, including middle and high school programs. Selection criteria data is based on school-reported information. Fall 2020 Diversity in Admissions priorities is included for applicable middle and high school programs. Note that the data on each school’s demographics and performance includes all students of the given subgroup who were enrolled in the school on November 13, 2020. Some of these students may not have been admitted under the admissions method(s) shown, as some students may have enrolled in the school outside the centralized admissions process (via waitlist, over-the-counter, or transfer), and schools may have changed admissions methods over the past few years. Admissions methods are only reported for grades K-12.
""3K and Pre-Kindergarten data are reported at the site level. See below for definitions of site types included in this report.

r2np-vamf,Performance Metrics for Workforce Development Programs,Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity),"<p style=""padding-bottom:10px""> The report contains thirteen (13) performance metrics for City's workforce development programs. Each metric can be breakdown by three demographic types (gender, race/ethnicity, and age group) and the program target population (e.g., youth and young adults, NYCHA communities) as well.</p>

<p style=""padding-bottom:10px"">This report is a key output of an integrated data system that collects, integrates, and generates disaggregated data by Mayor's Office for Economic Opportunity (NYC Opportunity). Currently, the report is generated by the integrated database incorporating data from 18 workforce development programs managed by 5 City agencies.</p>

<p style=""padding-bottom:10px"">There has been no single ""workforce development system"" in the City of New York. Instead, many discrete public agencies directly manage or fund local partners to deliver a range of different services, sometimes tailored to specific populations. As a result, program data have historically been fragmented as well, making it challenging to develop insights based on a comprehensive picture. To overcome it, NYC Opportunity collects data from 5 City agencies and builds the integrated database, and it begins to build a complete picture of how participants move through the system onto a career pathway.</p>

<p style=""padding-bottom:10px"">Each row represents a count of unique individuals for a specific performance metric, program target population, a specific demographic group, and a specific period. For example, if the Metric Value is 2000 with Clients Served (Metric Name), NYCHA Communities (Program Target Population), Asian (Subgroup), and 2019 (Period), you can say that ""In 2019, 2,000 Asian individuals participated programs targeting NYCHA communities. </p>

The data has been modified to ensure that if 50% or more of a tax lot is within a Walk to a Park Service area, then the entire lot is shown as served.

New York City, as part of the OneNYC 2050 Building a Strong and Fair City plan, has put forth a goal of 85 percent of New York City residents living within a walking distance of a park by 2030. The Walk to a Park initiative focuses on increasing access to parks and open spaces, concentrating on areas of the city that are under-resourced and where residents are living further than a walk to a park. NYC Parks calculates the number of New Yorkers within walking distance of a park and reports on this as part of the Mayor’s Management Report. “Walking distance” is defined as a 1/4-mile or less for sites such as small playgrounds and sitting areas; or a 1/2-mile or less for larger parks that serve a wider region, typically over 6 acres or with access to recreation center. Certain properties in NYC Parks' portfolio, such as cemeteries, community gardens, or sites with no recreational equipment were not included in this analysis. Similarly, some publicly accessible parks and open-space amenities not under the jurisdiction of NYC Parks were included in this analysis, as they provide recreational value.

This information is periodically updated and is only current as of the last publication date. The analysis is performed in part using secondary data. Data accuracy is limited by the scale and accuracy of the original sources.

One line of data is a structure. The dataset contains fields that are maintained by multiple agencies including NYC Parks, NYC DoITT, and NYC Planning. Where possible, updated values are pulled from authoritative sources and updated weekly - for more details about specific fields and where they come from please see https://github.com/NYCParks-data/Structures/wiki

The System ID and BIN (Building Identification Number) are both required fields.

A known limitation to this dataset is that functions other than 'comfort station' and 'recreation center' can and should be attributed to many of the structures. This information will eventually live and be maintained in a related table where all the functions of individual structures can be seen.

6ucq-tfej,2021 City Council - September Attendance Report,NYC Department of Education,"Attendance data include 3K-12 students in Districts 1-32 and 75 (Special Education). Students in District 79 (Alternative Programs), charter schools, home schooling, and home and hospital instruction are excluded. Infants in D79 (LYFE program) and students with a grade level ""AD"" (adult) are also excluded. Pre-K data do not include NYC Early Education Centers; therefore, Pre-K data are limited to those who attend K-12 schools that offer Pre-K and District Pre-K Centers.
This spreadsheet reports attendance rates (overall and remote) for September 13 through September 30, 2021. Data comprises attendance records for those dates reported by schools in ATS as of October 28, 2021.
Overall Attendance Rate is defined as the percent of days where students have present attendance status, out of total days with reported attendance data, across 13 days of attendance data September 13-30. Remote Instruction Attendance Rate* is defined as the percent of days where students have present remote attendance status out of total days with a remote attendance record reported, across 13 days of attendance data. Full attendance definitions for SY2021-22 can be found here: https://infohub.nyced.org/school-year/school-year-2021-22/attendance
Students participating in the Shared Instruction (SHIN) model may have their attendance recorded at separate sites, but attendance records are attributed to students’ home school of record as of the date of attendance.
Student demographic data is based on student records in ATS pulled on October 28, 2021. Because a small number of students are missing demographics data in ATS, demographic disaggregations may not roll up to higher-level aggregations. Data for Asian students include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islanders.
Students in temporary housing (STH) include all students who lack a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence as defined by Section 725 of the McKinney-Vento Act. It includes students who are identified as ""doubled up"" (sharing the housing of others due to economic hardship), or living in some other unstable, temporary housing. It does not include students who are identified as residing in shelters.
In order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, subgroups with fewer than 5 students are suppressed and have been replaced with an ""s"".
Instances where there are no reported attendance data have been marked with an ""NA"".

This was reported at the student level as this is a more useful metric for judging service provided. A full route, including all pick ups and drop offs would not be reflective of the time any individual student spent on the bus.
Current curb-to-school routing systems do not capture scheduled pick up times, therefore this metric could not be calculated. Pick up times are estimated by school bus companies and communicated to parents directly.
For stop-to-school routes the average scheduled student ride time was provided. As stated above, this could not be calculated for curb-to-school service as our current data structure does not support this

Students are reported as those who were planned and routed, but may or may not have used the service provided.
Routes were determined by those routed with a vendor and student(s) assigned
Vehicles are identified by school bus company reported data. This data is subject to data entry error and is dependent on the school bus companies to maintain.
All transportation sites were included, and reported by type. A transportation site was defined by a unique location identified by a street address. Please note: multiple students or schools can be located in the same address and would therefore represent a stop for multiple students at the same site.
MetroCard passes are assigned at the school. For public and charter schools, OPT reports students assigned to MetroCard, which includes those assigned a MetroCard by serial number or ""T'd"" for MetroCard, meaning the school indicated the student as eligible for a MetroCard but did not yet assign a serial number. For Non-Public schools, OPT reports on students who are eligible for MetoCards if they are not assigned to yellow bus service
Some special education schools do not classify students by grade level. Students attending such schools are identified as “NG.”
Service type is representative only of the type of busing a student is assigned to and is not reflective of the educational classification of a student. Students who are classified as special education but do not have an IEP mandate for specific transportation accommodations may be assigned to general education busing. General education students under certain circumstances including, but not limited to temporary housing status, orders of protection and medical conditions may be assigned to special education busing.
OPT assigns students to busing but cannot confirm student ridership. This reporting would have to be captured at the school level.
Students in temporary housing (STH) situations other than those reported to be living in a DHS shelter* were excluded from the report due to data quality issues. While the DOE student data system (ATS) has a housing indicator flag, it is often inaccurate and unreliable. Therefore, OPT cannot reliably report on the temporary housing status of students other than those residing in DHS shelters, where a daily report indicating shelter status is provided. 
*Transportation data for students in Foster Care is also provided. Please see section 21-993 B7 for reporting.
Stop to school bus service is typically not provided to students after the 6th grade. Those assigned to this service are students who are granted individual or school-wide exceptions.
In addition to students who applied for transportation because of foster care placement, also reported were students known to be in foster care who received busing or A MetroCard to provide a more complete report of students in foster care who received service.

9nt8-h7nd,2020 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs),Department of City Planning (DCP),"2020 Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) are medium-sized statistical geographies for reporting Decennial Census and American Community Survey (ACS). 2020 NTAs are created by aggregating 2020 census tracts and nest within Community District Tabulation Areas (CDTA). NTAs were delineated with the need for both geographic specificity and statistical reliability in mind. Consequently, each NTA contains enough population to mitigate sampling error associated with the ACS yet offers a unit of analysis that is smaller than a Community District.

Though NTA boundaries and their associated names roughly correspond with many neighborhoods commonly recognized by New Yorkers, NTAs are not intended to definitively represent neighborhoods, nor are they intended to be exhaustive of all possible names and understandings of neighborhoods throughout New York City. Additionally, non-residential areas including large parks, airports, cemeteries, and other special areas are represented separately within this dataset and are assigned codes according to their type (See NTAType field).

p48c-iqtu,NYC Wetlands,Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),"In 2016 NYC Parks contracted with the UVM Spatial Analysis Lab to use modern remote sensing and object-based image analysis to create a new wetlands map for New York City. Data inputs include Light Detection and Ranging Data, State and Federal Wetland Inventories, soils, and field data. Because the map was conservative in its wetlands predictions, NYC Parks staff improved the map through a series of desktop and field verification efforts. From June to November 2020, NYC Parks staff field verified the majority of wetlands on NYC Parks' property. 

The map will be opportunistically updated depending on available field information and delineations. Another dedicated field verification effort has not been planned. As of June 2021, no subsequent updates to the data are scheduled. 

Original field names were updated to field names that are easier to understand. 

This dataset was developed to increase awareness regarding the location and extent of wetlands to promote restoration and conservation in New York City. This map does not supersede U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) wetlands maps and has no jurisdictional authority. It should be used alongside NWI and NYSDEC datasets as a resource for identifying likely locations of wetlands in New York City. Mapped features vary in the confidence of their verification status, ranging from ""Unverified"" (meaning the feature exists in its original remotely mapped form and has not been ground truthed) to ""Verified - Wetland Delineation"" (meaning the boundaries and type of wetland have been verified during an official wetland delineation). Because of the rapid nature of the protocol and the scale of data collection, this product is not a subsitute for on-site investigations and field delineations. The dataset also includes broad classifications for each wetland type, e.g. estuarine, emergent wetland, forested wetland, shrub/scrub wetland, or water. Cowardin classifcations were not used given rapid verfication methods. 

The accuracy of the wetlands map has improved over time as a result of the verification process. Fields were added over time as necessitated by the workflow and values were updated with information, either from the field verifications, delineation reports, or desktop analysis.

Each line of data represents one instance of a particular plant species in a specific container size within the dataset.  Data is generated using groware software application to export to an excel document.  Data is updated ad hoc, depending on production and distribution needs (sometimes multiple times daily, other times 1xweekly or bi-weekly, for example). Data has not been geocoded, anonymized, etc to the best of my knowledge. The dataset changes to include new species that are grown and were not prevously distributed by GNPC. The dataset also has entries removed over time, as species are no longer grown. All fields are required.

Total cases has been calculated as the sum of daily confirmed and probable cases. Seven-day averages of confirmed, probable, and total cases are also included in the dataset.
A person is classified as a confirmed COVID-19 case if they test positive with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT, also known as a molecular test; e.g. a PCR test). A probable case is a person who meets the following criteria with no positive molecular test on record: a) test positive with an antigen test, b) have symptoms and an exposure to a confirmed COVID-19 case, or c) died and their cause of death is listed as COVID-19 or similar.

Prior to June 9, 2021, new cases were counted ≥365 days after the first date of specimen collection or clinical diagnosis.
Any person with a residence outside of NYC is not included in counts. 
Data is sourced from electronic laboratory reporting from the New York State Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System to the NYC Health Department.

</p>
NAAT tests work through direct detection of the virus’s genetic material, and typically involve collecting a nasal swab. These tests are highly accurate and recommended for diagnosing current COVID-19 infection. After specimen collection, molecular tests are processed in a laboratory, and results are electronically reported to the New York State (NYS) Electronic Clinical Laboratory Results System (ECLRS). Test results for NYC residents are then sent electronically to NYC DOHMH. There is typically a lag of a few days between when a specimen is collected and when a result is reported to NYC DOHMH.

6qs8-44ki,DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),"This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people,  stratified by modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) of residence. Modified ZCTA reflects the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result. This unit of geography is similar to ZIP codes but combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation. It can be challenging to map data that are reported by ZIP Code. A ZIP Code doesn’t refer to an area, but rather a collection of points that make up a mail delivery route. Furthermore, there are some buildings that have their own ZIP Code, and some non-residential areas with ZIP Codes. To deal with the challenges of ZIP Codes, the Health Department uses ZCTAs which solidify ZIP codes into units of area. Often, data reported by ZIP code are actually mapped by ZCTA. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-modzcta.csv  Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.
</br>
These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City;  therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.

In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders)

Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. 

Antibody tests are categorized based on the date of specimen collection and are aggregated by full weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. This dataset includes testing data beginning April 5, 2020.

Data are updated daily, and the dataset preserves historical records and source data changes, so each extract date reflects the current copy of the data as of that date. For example, an extract date of 11/04/2020 and extract date of 11/03/2020 will both contain all records as they were as of that extract date. Without filtering or grouping by extract date, an analysis will almost certainly be miscalculating or counting the same values multiple times. To analyze the most current data, only use the latest extract date. Antibody tests that are missing dates are not included in the dataset; as dates are identified, these events are added.   Lags between occurrence and report of cases and tests can be assessed by comparing counts and rates across multiple data extract dates.

vajk-p37e,DOHMH COVID-19 Antibody-by-Neighborhood Poverty,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),"This dataset contains information on antibody testing for COVID-19: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, and the rate of testing per 100,000 people, stratified by ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) neighborhood poverty group. These data can also be accessed here: https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/blob/master/totals/antibody-by-poverty.csv 


Exposure to COVID-19 can be detected by measuring antibodies to the disease in a person’s blood, which can indicate that a person may have had an immune response to the virus. Antibodies are proteins produced by the body’s immune system that can be found in the blood. People can test positive for antibodies after they have been exposed, sometimes when they no longer test positive for the virus itself. It is important to note that the science around COVID-19 antibody tests is evolving rapidly and there is still much uncertainty about what individual antibody test results mean for a single person and what population-level antibody test results mean for understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a population level.

These data only provide information on people tested. People receiving an antibody test do not reflect all people in New York City; therefore, these data may not reflect antibody prevalence among all New Yorkers. Increasing instances of screening programs further impact the generalizability of these data, as screening programs influence who and how many people are tested over time. Examples of screening programs in NYC include: employers screening their workers (e.g., hospitals), and long-term care facilities screening their residents.

In addition, there may be potential biases toward people receiving an antibody test who have a positive result because people who were previously ill are preferentially seeking testing, in addition to the testing of persons with higher exposure (e.g., health care workers, first responders.)

Neighborhood-level poverty groups were classified in a manner consistent with Health Department practices to describe and monitor disparities in health in NYC. Neighborhood poverty measures are defined as the percentage of people earning below the Federal Poverty Threshold (FPT) within a ZCTA. The standard cut-points for defining categories of neighborhood-level poverty in NYC are:
•	Low: <10% of residents in ZCTA living below the FPT
•	Medium: 10% to <20%
•	High: 20% to <30%
•	Very high: ≥30% residents living below the FPT
The ZCTAs used for classification reflect the first non-missing address within NYC for each person reported with an antibody test result.

Rates were calculated using interpolated intercensal population estimates updated in 2019. These rates differ from previously reported rates based on the 2000 Census or previous versions of population estimates. The Health Department produced these population estimates based on estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and NYC Department of City Planning. Rates for poverty were calculated using direct standardization for age at diagnosis and weighting by the US 2000 standard population.

For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Wednesday, May 6 would be categorized as tested during the week ending May 9.

msid-end4,Mosquito control events in NYC – Adult Mosquito Truck Spraying and Aerial Larviciding Events,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),"This dataset shows the mosquito spraying events in NYC.
</br>
The Health Department monitors mosquito populations and applies pesticides when appropriate throughout the summer to reduce the number of mosquitoes and to minimize the risk of mosquito-borne diseases such as the West Nile Virus and the Zika Virus.			
</p>
This dataset contains information about when and where mosquito spraying events occur in NYC. DOHMH sprays pesticides from trucks to kill adult mosquitoes (adulticiding) or to kill mosquito larvae (larviciding) in areas that have an increased risk of mosquito spreading disease. These events – in residential and non-residential areas – are carefully planned by DOHMH to minimize human exposure to the pesticides.   DOHMH creates the spray event boundaries and stores them in a GIS. Each record represent the extent/boundaries of a spray treatment area. The spray events are not fixed, each year the locations, boundaries and extents are determined by a variety of factors throughout the mosquito season.

j55h-3upk,Children's Play Areas (CPAs),Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR),"**Please note that this dataset was created for a specific analysis and is not currently maintained as of 2019**

This dataset captures Children's Play Areas (CPAs). CPAs are places within NYC Parks that have Play Units installed. Play Units are equipment designated for children. A single CPA is defined as a centroid (Point geometry) of a cluster of Play Units. While otherwise known as playgrounds, this term is deliberately avoided because Properties or subproperties named as 'playgrounds' may contain more than just Play Units (e.g., adult fitness equipment, basketball/handball courts, etc.), and may not contain Play Units at all.

For more background on this dataset, details about how it's derived, what you can learn from it (e.g. ""is there a play area near me?""), how it can be joined with other Parks data (e.g., Properties), maps and analysis - please see:

Hepatitis B surveillance data include all confirmed and probable cases. The Health Department often receives more than one report for each person with chronic hepatitis B and uses automatic de-duplication methods to identify repeat reports based on name, date of birth, and other information. Only the first report is counted in the data presented here. Laboratories are required to electronically report positive hepatitis B test results, as well as negative results for hepatitis B DNA. The Health Department does not routinely investigate hepatitis B reports because of the large volume; therefore it is difficult to determine when people with these infections were first infected, although most were probably infected a while ago. Case counts represent people newly reported with hepatitis B and are not prevalence or incidence. Many people with hepatitis B are asymptomatic; as a result, many cases are not diagnosed or reported. Therefore, surveillance data underestimate the true level of chronic hepatitis B in NYC.",203,1105,3076,Health,"['hep b', 'hepatitis b', 'hepatitis']",2020-01-30T17:30:15+0000,2021-07-21T20:31:26+0000,2021-07-21T20:31:27+0000,2021-07-21T20:31:26+0000,data.cityofnewyork.us,,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/szfr-d24y,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/szfr-d24y

Speed cushions are either speed humps or speed tables that include wheel cutouts to allow large vehicles to pass unaffected, while reducing passenger car speeds. They can be offset to allow unimpeded passage by emergency vehicles and are typically used on key emergency response routes. Speed humps are generally installed on local residential (non-truck route, non-bus route locations), while speed cushions are generally installed on designated truck route locations and bus route locations.

Only the first report is counted in the data presented here. Laboratories are required to electronically report positive hepatitis C test results, as well as negative results for hepatitis C RNA. For chronic hepatitis C, in 2016, the CDC/CSTE case definition for confirmed or probable cases was changed. CDC’s 2016 case definition is used for people first reported with chronic hepatitis C in 2016 and onward. The Health Department does not routinely investigate hepatitis C reports because of the large volume; therefore it is difficult to determine when people with these infections were first infected, although most were probably infected a while ago. Case counts represent people newly reported with hepatitis C and are not prevalence or incidence. Many people with hepatitis C are asymptomatic; as a result, many cases are not diagnosed or reported.

Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.
</p>
The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.
</p>
Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",5438651,19036,7670,Public Safety,"['nypd', 'collisions', 'bigapps', 'big apps', 'visionzero', 'vision', 'zero', 'nycopendata', 'traffic data', 'victim']",2019-07-30T19:27:54+0000,2019-12-09T22:44:37+0000,2024-08-16T23:25:21+0000,2019-12-09T22:44:37+0000,data.cityofnewyork.us,,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/f55k-p6yu,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/f55k-p6yu

Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.

This dataset contains information on all items designated or under consideration for designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC). The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the ""MOST_CURRENT,"" ""BBL_STATUS and ""LAST_ACTION_ON_LP"" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this data set.

The survey ranks among the largest surveys of any kind ever conducted nationally. 

Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute a measure of diversification that goes beyond test scores on the Progress Report. NYC School Survey results contribute 10% - 15% of a school's Progress Report grade (the exact contribution to the Progress Report is dependent on school type).

The OATH Trials Division dataset contains information about a diverse range of complex administrative law matters that are filed by city agencies, boards, and commissions and adjudicated by OATH Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) at the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, Trials Division. 
 
Such matters include civil service disciplinary and disability cases, city contract disputes, license revocation proceedings, prevailing wage proceedings, discrimination cases, loft law proceedings, Krimstock cases, where car owners seek return of  vehicle seized during an arrest, campaign finance law and conflicts of interest law cases, alleged violations of consumer protection laws, and fair work week and paid sick leave laws.  
 
The Trials Division dataset includes those closed cases where litigants appear before the Trials Division for trial and where an OATH Administrative Law Judge has issued a decision. By law or by agency rule, the OATH ALJ issues final decisions in Krimstock cases, contract disputes and most cases brought by the Department of Consumer Affairs.

tap2-dwrw,Mayor’s Office of Operations: Demographic Survey,Mayor’s Office of Operations (OPS),"Pursuant to Local Laws 126, 127, and 128 of 2016, certain demographic data is collected voluntarily and anonymously by persons voluntarily seeking social services.  This data can be used by agencies and the public to better understand the demographic makeup of client populations and to better understand and serve residents of all backgrounds and identities.

The data presented here has been collected through either electronic form or paper surveys offered at the point of application for services. These surveys are anonymous.

Each record represents an anonymized demographic profile of an individual applicant for social services, disaggregated by response option, agency, and program. Response options include information regarding ancestry, race, primary and secondary languages, English proficiency, gender identity, and sexual orientation.

Idiosyncrasies or Limitations: 
Note that while the dataset contains the total number of individuals who have identified their ancestry or languages spoke, because such data is collected anonymously, there may be instances of a single individual completing multiple voluntary surveys. Additionally, the survey being both voluntary and anonymous has advantages as well as disadvantages: it increases the likelihood of full and honest answers, but since it is not connected to the individual case, it does not directly inform delivery of services to the applicant. The paper and online versions of the survey ask the same questions but free-form text is handled differently. Free-form text fields are expected to be entered in English although the form is available in several languages. Surveys are presented in 11 languages.  
  Paper Surveys
   1. Are optional
   2. Survey taker is expected to specify agency that provides service
   2. Survey taker can skip or elect not to answer questions
   3. Invalid/unreadable data may be entered for survey date or date may be skipped
   4. OCRing of free-form tet fields may fail.
   5. Analytical value of free-form text answers is unclear

Salting roads represents an effective method for preventing weather-related collisions.

The MTI K-5 physical activity program is designed to create and support an active learning environment in the classroom and school community. MTI activities blend academics and physical activity into educational lessons that support New York State PE Learning Standards and are integrated with Common Core Learning Standards.

The MTI program is free and includes benefits and incentives for students, teachers, principals, and schools.
MTI activities are inclusive and designed to enhance academic learning during classroom instruction.
A growing body of research suggests that student success depends on a combination of academic skills, healthy lifestyle, and physical and mental fitness. Specifically, in NYC, the correlation between fitness levels and academic achievement has been shown:

MTI All-Star school

Schools with a comprehensive PE program, led by a certified or designated PE teacher, have the opportunity to become an MTI All-Star school by training at least 85% of their eligible teachers in MTI.

New York State requires all elementary schools to provide at least 120 minutes of PE every week for all students. MTI All-Star schools can use MTI activities during classroom instructional time to supplement their existing PE program to meet this requirement.

MTI All-Star schools receive MTI implementation guidance and Citywide recognition of MTI best practices

All NYC district public schools with classroom teachers serving grades K-5 are eligible to participate in the MTI program.

For the 2016-2017 school year, elementary schools can participate in MTI in two ways:

1) MTI Train-the-Trainer

- Certified or designated PE teachers from district public elementary schools can attend an MTI Train-the-Trainer (TTT) session where they will learn to become MTI trainers for their school.

- TTT sessions are offered during school hours so PE teachers will need to be released to attend.

2) MTI Event

- K-5 classroom teachers (including cluster, PE, and special education) from district public schools can register for an open MTI workshop session offered citywide.

- Participating teachers receive UFT negotiated training rate (for after-school hours) and a certificate of completion (can count towards the 175 hours of professional development; contingent on principal’s approval).""",4288,508,1245,Education,,2017-06-26T22:25:36+0000,2018-09-10T19:06:46+0000,2017-06-26T22:43:33+0000,2018-09-10T19:06:46+0000,data.cityofnewyork.us,,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/arzb-yfdv,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/arzb-yfdv

The cohort consists of all students who first entered 9th grade in a given school year (e.g., the Cohort of 2006 entered 9th grade in the 2006-2007 school year).  Graduates are defined as those students earning either a Local or Regents diploma and exclude those earning either a special education (IEP) diploma or GED. 

In order to comply with FERPA regulations on public reporting of education outcomes, rows with a cohort of 20 or fewer students are suppressed.
Due to the small number of students identified as Native American or Multi-Racial, these ethnicities are not reported on the Ethnicity tab; however, these students are included in the counts on all other tabs.
4 Year August outcomes are available for the 2004-2011 cohorts at the citywide level and for the 2005-2011 cohorts at the borough, district and school level. 5 Year August outcomes are available for the 2006-2010 cohorts. Cells are blank when data is not available.
Charter schools are not included in the NYSED calculation of graduation rates for NYC.
School level results are not presented for District 79 and District 75 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.
Starting with the 2009 cohort (Class of 2013), students with IEPs could use the compensatory score option (CSO) to meet graduation requirements, which contributed to an increase in the graduation rate.

Rat Information Portal Data Release Notes        April 20, 2015

The Rat Information Portal (RIP) is a web-based mapping application where users can view rat inspection data. 

Data sources: NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Division of Environmental Health Pest Control Database

Notes on data limitations: Please note that if a property/taxlot does not appear in the file, that does not indicate an absence of rats - rather just that it has not been inspected. Similarly, neighborhoods with higher numbers properties with active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.

OPT staff use a variety of systems to generate and share bus route information with bus vendors and the public.

In this dataset, OPT has provided all the route information that does not risk disclosing personally identifiable information. 
School-age service for students in grades K through 12 are contracted with bus vendors on a per route basis. OPT also manages bus service for Pre-K students who require curb-to-curb service as per a student’s Individualized Education Plan (IEP).

As a consequence of this difference, OPT does not design bus routes for Pre-K service, so those routes are not included in this dataset.

k397-673e,Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year),Office of Payroll Administration (OPA),"Data is collected because of public interest in how the City’s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees. Data is input into the City's Personnel Management System (“PMS”) by the respective user Agencies. Each record represents the following statistics for every city employee: Agency, Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial, Agency Start Date, Work Location Borough, Job Title Description, Leave Status as of the close of the FY (June 30th), Base Salary, Pay Basis, Regular Hours Paid, Regular Gross Paid, Overtime Hours worked, Total Overtime Paid, and Total Other Compensation (i.e. lump sum and/or retro payments). This data can be used to analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime. The reader of this data should be aware that increments of salary increases received over the course of any one fiscal year will not be reflected. All that is captured, is the employee's final base and gross salary at the end of the fiscal year.  In very limited cases, a check replacement and subsequent refund may reflect both the original check as well as the re-issued check in employee pay totals.  
<br>
<b>NOTE 1: </b>To further improve the visibility into the number of employee OT hours worked, beginning with the FY 2023 report, an updated methodology will be used which will eliminate redundant reporting of OT hours in some specific instances.  In the previous calculation, hours associated with both overtime pay as well as an accompanying overtime “companion code” pay were included in the employee total even though they represented pay for the same period of time.  With the updated methodology, the dollars shown on the Open Data site will continue to be inclusive of both types of overtime, but the OT hours will now reflect a singular block of time, which will result in a more representative total of employee OT hours worked.   The updated methodology will primarily impact the OT hours associated with City employees in uniformed civil service titles.  The updated methodology will be applied to the Open Data posting for Fiscal Year 2023 and cannot be applied to prior postings and, as a result, the reader of this data should not compare OT <b>hours</b>  prior to the 2023 report against OT hours published starting Fiscal Year 2023.  The reader of this data may continue to compare OT <b>dollars</b> across all published Fiscal Years on Open Data.

43nn-pn8j,DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results,Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH),"The dataset contains every sustained or not yet adjudicated violation citation from every full or special program inspection conducted up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias in an active status on the RECORD DATE (date of the data pull). When an inspection results in more than one violation, values for associated fields are repeated for each additional violation record.  Establishments are uniquely identified by their CAMIS (record ID) number. Keep in mind that thousands of restaurants start business and go out of business every year; only restaurants in an active status are included in the dataset. 
Records are also included for each restaurant that has applied for a permit but has not yet been inspected and for inspections resulting in no violations. Establishments with inspection date of 1/1/1900 are new establishments that have not yet received an inspection. Restaurants that received no violations are represented by a single row and coded as having no violations using the ACTION field. 
Because this dataset is compiled from several large administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that could be a result of data entry or transfer errors. Data may also be missing. 
This dataset and the information on the Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website come from the same data source.  The Health Department’s Restaurant Grading website is here:

Due to success of the CompStat program, NYPD began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999 in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents, injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically, using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department’s crime data warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable.",2109518,565489,186185,Public Safety,"['nypd', 'collisions', 'bigapps', 'big apps', 'visionzero', 'vision', 'zero', 'nycopendata', 'traffic data']",2014-04-28T16:41:44+0000,2021-04-19T14:42:58+0000,2024-08-16T22:48:14+0000,2021-04-19T14:42:58+0000,data.cityofnewyork.us,,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/h9gi-nx95,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/h9gi-nx95

5i9t-mvdt,NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO) Debt Outstanding Since FY 2000,NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO),"Amount of debt outstanding as of June 30 of each year.

SOURCES: IBO; New York City Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Comptroller (various years); Annual Report of the Comptroller on Capital Debt and Obligations (various years); New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports (various years)
NOTES: 1In determining what to include as outstanding debt of the City of New York, IBO considered: (1) the city's obligation (contractual and moral) to repay the debt, (2) whether the revenues pledged toward the repayment of the debt would have otherwise accrued to the city, and (3) whether the proceeds of the debt issuance accrue directly to the city.
2GO debt is net of bonds held for debt service on other city-related obligations, referred to in the Comptroller's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) as Treasury Obligations. The 2000–2002 CAFRs show outstanding general obligation debt, before Treasury Obligations, in 2000 and 2001 as $26,892 million and $26,836 million, respectively. However, CAFRs from 2003 on show higher GO debt for the two years, $353 million more for 2000 and $311 million more for 2001; the 2003 CAFR does not provide a note explaining the revisions. IBO uses the numbers reported from 2003 forward.
3Fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003 include short-term bond anticipation notes outstanding at year-end of $515 million, $2.2 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively.
4For fiscal year 2000, Capital Lease Obligations to HHC and PCDC are reported jointly. 
5In FY 2008, JSDC bonds outstanding were redeemed with GO bond proceeds, resulting in the elimination of JSDC debt, a reduction in conduit debt outstanding and partially accounting for the increase in GO debt from 2007 to 2008
														
General Obligation:
General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the city. City property tax collections are pledged first to pay the principal and interest on these bonds.
														
														
Treasury Obligations:
Treasury obligations are New York City bonds held as investments by the city or by the related entities covered here, including MAC and SFC. They are netted out in order to avoid double counting of the city's obligations.
														
Transitional Finance Authority:
Created in 1997, the Transitional Finance Authority (TFA) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TFA General Purpose Bonds are secured by the city's collections of personal income tax and, if necessary, sales tax.  Recovery Bonds, issued in response to the events of September 11, 2001 differ from general purpose bonds in that they are excluded from the calculation of outstanding TFA debt allowed under the debt limit.
														
TFA Building Aid Revenue Bonds:
In fiscal year 2006, the city was authorized by the state Legislature to assign to the TFA all or any portion of the state building aid payable to the city or its school district. The TFA in turn is authorized to issue bonds secured by the aid and dedicated to financing a portion of the city's educational facilities capital plan.
														
TSASC:
TSASC Inc. (formerly known as the Tobacco Settlement Asset Securitization Corporation) is a separate legal entity from the City of New York. TSASC bonds are secured by the corporation's purchase from the city of the future revenue stream under a settlement agreement resolving cigarette smoking-related litigation between the settling states and participating manufacturers.
														
Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York:
The Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, created in 1975 and formally dissolved in 2008. With New York City experiencing a severe fiscal crisis in 1975, MAC allowed the city continued access to credit markets and assisted in the prevention of a default of city general obligation bonds. MAC bonds were secured by state collections of certain sales and compensating use taxes (imposed by the state within the city at rates formerly imposed by the city), the stock transfer tax, and certain per capita state aid.
														
Samurai Funding Corporation:
The Samurai Funding Corporation (SFC) was a separate legal entity from the City of New York, which issued Japanese yen-denominated bonds. The yen-denominated bonds were secured by the proceeds of New York City general obligation bonds held by SFC.
														
Conduit Debt:
The city makes annual appropriations from its general fund for agreements with other entities that issue debt to build or maintain facilities on behalf of the city. These agreements are known as ""leaseback"" transactions, where the city makes rental payments to the partner entity in an amount sufficient to pay the entity's debt service on the securities issued for the respective capital expenditures. These entities, though legally separate from the city, either provide services exclusively to the city, have governance boards whose majority is appointed by the city, or are otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on the activities of the entity.
														
Excluded Items:
IBO considered several other items for inclusion as outstanding debt of the City of New York that were ultimately determined not to constitute obligations of the city, including: outstanding bonds of the Fiscal Year 2005 Securitization Corporation (FSC), outstanding bonds of the Sales Tax Asset Receivable Corporation (STAR), notes of the Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), and general capital lease obligations.
														
FSC is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to acquire securities, held in escrow, which economically defeased city general obligation bonds. As the general obligation bonds in question are included in the calculation of outstanding general obligation debt, the inclusion of the FSC bonds as well would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count FSC debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.
														
STAR is a financing instrumentality of the city, formed for the purpose of issuing bonds, the proceeds of which were used to assume the remaining obligations of MAC. STAR pays the debt service on these bonds with revenues received from the Local Government Assistance Corporation, a state entity whose revenues are 1 percent of the statewide sales tax. The debt of STAR is not an obligation of the city, and the revenues used to pay STAR debt service would not accrue to the city in the corporation's absence. As such, IBO does not count STAR debt outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.
														
HYIC entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to purchase from the MTA Transferrable Development Rights.  $200 million of notes were issued by HYIC, the proceeds of which were used to execute the transaction. Debt service on the notes was paid from the proceeds of the bonds issued by HYIC which are included in IBO's definition of outstanding debt under conduit debt.  Therefore, inclusion in outstanding debt of the notes in addition to the bonds would constitute a double counting. As such, IBO does not count HYIC notes outstanding toward total New York City debt outstanding.
														
In addition to the capital leases deemed to be debt obligations of the city under conduit debt, various city agencies have entered into leases that have been determined under generally accepted accounting practices to be capital leases. Unlike issuers of conduit debt, the lessors of these general lease obligations do not exist to provide services exclusively to the city, do not have boards the majority of whose members are appointed by the city, or are not otherwise subject to the city's imposition of its will on their activities. These general capital lease obligations do not constitute an obligation of the city toward any bonds or other borrowing. As such, IBO does not count general capital lease obligations toward total New York City debt outstanding.

NOTES:</br>
(1) Debt service is the cost to New York City of repaying its outstanding debt, including both principal and interest. The figures in the table have been adjusted to reflect debt service that was originally scheduled for payment in each year since 2000.</br>

(2) New York City is required to have a balanced annual budget. In years when it runs a surplus, the primary means the city uses to comply with this requirement is to use up some or all of the surplus by prepaying some of the subsequent years' debt service expenses. As a result, the cash outlay for debt service in a given year is not an accurate representation of the true cost of debt service in that year.</br>

Each row in this dataset contains discrete information about one violation of the New York City Housing Maintenance Code or New York State Multiple Dwelling Law. Each violation is identified using a unique Violation ID. These Laws are in place to provide requirements for the maintenance of residential dwelling units within New York City. 
Violations are issued by Housing Inspectors after a physical inspection is conducted (except for class I violations which are generally  administratively issued).  Violations are issued in four classes: Class A (non-hazardous), Class B (hazardous), Class C (immediately hazardous) and Class I (information orders).  For more information on violations, see https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page  
The base data for this file is all violations open as of October 1, 2012.  Violation data is updated daily.  The daily update includes both new violations and updates to the status of previously issued violations. An open violation is a violation which is still active on the Department records. See the status table for determining how to filter for open violations versus closed violations, and within open violations for a more detailed current status. 
The property owner may or may not have corrected the physical condition if the status is open. The violation status is closed when the violation is observed/verified as corrected by HPD or as certified by the landlord.   The processes for having violations dismissed are described at http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/compliance-clear-violations.page

yk6f-pa7p,LAW Public Service Program,Law Department (LAW),"Early in his tenure at the Law Department, Corporation Counsel Michael A. Cardozo initiated the Public Service Program - a private/public partnership with the City's prominent law firms, where firms either lend their attorneys to the Law Department for a finite period of time or agree to take on City cases in-house. The Program benefits both the City and the law firms. The City receives the assistance of an incredibly well-trained and talented group of attorneys while the attorneys receive the kind of hands-on, in-court litigation experience that is often hard to come by at the best private law firms. While participation in the Program will not lead to offers of permanent employment at the Law Department, it will enable the volunteers to keep their skills fresh while serving the public. 
Trial Attorney Volunteers: A number of firms lend mid-level litigation associates to the Law Department for a period of four to six months to work full-time in our Tort Division trial units. These attorneys conduct back-to-back civil trials, selecting juries, examining and cross-examining witnesses and presenting opening statements and closing arguments.
Law Firm Volunteers: Other firms have chosen to take entire matters in-house, giving their attorneys the chance to participate in court conferences, settlement negotiations, depositions, and, ultimately, trials.
Deposition Program: Firms also lend associates to the Law Department either to conduct a series of depositions in an individual case or to spend two to three weeks in our offices conducting back-to-back depositions in a variety of cases.",63,970,1960,City Government,"['law', 'justice', 'legislation', 'law public service program']",2013-02-06T18:19:07+0000,2018-09-10T19:24:21+0000,2013-06-21T20:07:07+0000,2018-09-10T19:24:21+0000,data.cityofnewyork.us,http://www.nyc.gov/html/law/html/about/service_firms.shtml,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/d/yk6f-pa7p,https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/yk6f-pa7p

¶•The New York State Education Department adopted Aspirational Performance Measures (APM) in addition to high school graduation rates for the Cohort of 2006 (Class of 2010). In addition to the numbers of students earning Advanced Regents Designation on their diplomas, another metric was developed based on performance on Math and ELA Regents exams. The Math/ELA APM represents the percentage of students in the cohort who graduated with any regular diploma (Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents Diploma, or Local Diploma) and who scored 80 or greater on their highest mathematics Regents and 75 or greater on the English Regents. Since this metric is new for the Class of 2010, only one year of results is reported, separately for June and August graduation cohorts. The total number of students in the cohort is the same in June and August. 
¶•Records with cohorts of 20 students or less are suppressed. 
¶•August outcomes include all June and August graduates. 
¶•In school-level reporting, students who were in a school for less than 5 months are not included in the school’s cohort, but are included in citywide totals. 
¶•School level results are not presented for District 79 schools, but their outcomes are included in citywide totals.

##Indicates how special class is delivered

For schools with students in any grades between Kindergarten and 9th grade (where 9th grade is the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by four program areas: general education, special education self-contained class, collaborative team teaching and gifted and talented self-contained class. Within each program area class size is reported by grade or service category, which indicates how a special education self-contained class is delivered. Class size is calculated by dividing the number of students in a program and grade by the number of official classes in that program and grade. 

The following data is excluded from all the reports: District 75 schools, bridge classes which span more than one grade, classes with fewer than five students (for other than special education self-contained classes) and classes with one student (for special education self-contained classes). On the summary reports programs and grades with three or fewer classes are excluded from the citywide, borough and region reports and programs and grades with one class are excluded from the district report. For schools with students in any grades between 9th and 12th grade (where 9th grade is not the termination grade for the school), class size is reported by two program areas: general education and special education. For general education students class size is reported by grade for each core subject area: English, Math, Science and Social Studies. For special education students with a self-contained program recommendation, class size is reported by service category (self-contained or mainstream) for each core subject area. Since high school classes may contain students in multiple grades and programs, class size is calculated by taking a weighted average of all the classes in a core subject area with students in a particular grade or program. For example, there are 75 ninth graders enrolled at a high school. 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 28 students, a second group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 25 students, and a third group of 25 ninth graders attend a Math class with 30 students. Average class size for ninth grade Math equals: (25x28 + 25x25 + 25x30)/75 = 27.7. 

The Pupil Teacher Ratio is also provided on the school level report. Pupil Teacher Ratio is another means to evaluate the instructional resources provided at a school. Pupil Teacher Ratio for All Students is calculated by dividing the number of students at a school by the number of full-time equivalent teachers, including both teachers in classes taught by two teachers, “cluster” teachers providing instruction in specialized topics like art or science, and teachers providing special education instruction.

Peer indices are calculated differently depending on School Level.  Schools are only compared to other schools in the same School Level (e.g., Elementary, K-8, Middle, High)

1) Elementary & K-8 - peer index is a value from 0-100.  We use a composite demographic statistic based on % ELL, % SpEd, % Title I free lunch, and % Black/Hispanic.  Higher values indicate student populations with higher need

2) Middle & High - peer index is a value from 1.00-4.50.  For middle schools, we use the average 4th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 4th grade test scores.  For high schools, we use the average 8th grade proficiency ratings in ELA and Math for all their students that have 8th grade test scores.  Lower values indicate student populations with higher need

3) D84 / Charter Schools - the overall score does not include the results of the learning environment survey. 

4) Schools for Transfer Students - consists of schools with large populations of high school students transferring from NYC High Schools or from out of state/country.  No peer index value is assigned because this set of schools is its own peer group. The reports contain 3 categories with one additional credit section.  Unlike the HS Progress Report, the Environment Category is only composed of Survey Results.  Performance measures 6-year graduation rate and Progress captures student level improvements in attendance, credit accumulation and Regents passed.
